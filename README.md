This repository contains the code implementation and analysis of linear regression for the Boston Housing dataset. The project aims to build a predictive model for housing prices in Boston using various regression techniques and evaluate the model's performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "boston.csv" file, which includes several features related to housing prices in Boston. The features include:
- CRIM: Per capita crime rate by town
- ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
- INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
- CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
- NOX: Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
- RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling
- AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
- DIS: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
- RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways
- TAX: Full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
- PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town
- LSTAT: % lower status of the population
- MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's

## Project Overview
The project includes the following steps and techniques:
- Data preprocessing and splitting into training and test sets
- Implementing linear regression and evaluating the model's performance
- Testing alternative regression models such as Lasso and Ridge
- Hyperparameter optimization using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV
- Regularization with Lasso and Ridge techniques
- Cross-validation using KFold
- Evaluation metrics including Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R2 Score

## Installation and Usage

## Results and Analysis
The project provides insights into the performance of linear regression and alternative regression models on the Boston Housing dataset. It evaluates the impact of different features on housing prices and demonstrates the effectiveness of regularization techniques in improving the model's generalization.
